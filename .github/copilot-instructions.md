Project: twilio-account-migrate-cli
Context: Node.js CLI to migrate Twilio resources between accounts. Prefer ESM syntax. Use Inquirer for prompts. Save fetched data to data/{source,dest}. Build mapping in data/mapping/sid-mapping.json.
Guidelines: Keep functions small and reusable. Favor async/await. Add unit tests in __tests__.
